*Laravel* -> Laravel is a free, open source and one of the more popular php
web framework based on MVC architectural pattern

Taylor Otwell in June 2011

*Uses* -> Create web app
    -> create API

MVC -> separation of concerns , code organization
-> M for Model -> Database (SQL Queries)
-> V for View  -> User Interface (HTML)
-> C for Controller -> Business Logic (Mediator between M and V)

how MVC works here?
User -> Rquest dega jo ki server se sidha jaegi Controller ke ps 
     -> fir  model ke ps jaega
    -> request  send krega model ko 
     -> model response mai data bhejega controller ko
    -> controller same data send krega view ko jo ache se design krke 
    dikhage response mai



Why MVC?
-> organized code
-> independent block
-> easy to maintain
-> easy to modify
->code reusability
-> platform independence
->improved collabration

Framework -> Programming framework are sets of pre-written code and libraries tht provide a foundation for developing
software applications
