php artisan make:observer PostObserver --model=Post  -> to make observer file in larvel

Observer are basically used for events

if we want that the event should not trigger in particular case than we can use
$user->saveQuietly();
$user->deleteQuietly();
$user->restoreQuietly();
$user->forceDeleteQuietly();

//define global Scopes
php artisan make:scope UserScope
 -> in this we will get a apply function 

-> we can also remove scope on some particular part by using
$users = User::withoutGlobalScope(UserScope::class)->get();
